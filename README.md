# Plant Disease Detector 

PlantDiseaseDetector is a machine learning project designed to assist farmers in detecting crop diseases and early fire detection using computer vision. The project utilizes YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and segmentation, enabling efficient monitoring and management of agricultural fields.

Features
Crop Disease Detection: Identify various diseases in crops using images of leaves.
Early Fire Detection: Detect early signs of fire in agricultural fields to prevent large-scale damage.
Real-Time Detection: Leverage YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and classification.
GPU Support: Optimize training and inference using GPU acceleration.
